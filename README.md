# Data Projects

# MSU Analytics Hub  

- Overhauled the main MSU Baseball analytics hub for more efficient code.
- Added multiple new apps and deployed them into the new MSU Baseball Analytics home.
- Made through R Shiny/Posit dashboards.



# Stuff+ Model | Matchup Scores 
- Used big data from all 2023/2024 BIG10 games to train a model to identify higher levels of pitches.
- Matchup scores were created by using each pitcher's stuff+ of each pitch type, then averaging them out and comparing them to a hitter's reverse stuff+ (Big Bat+), then weighting based on pitch %.
